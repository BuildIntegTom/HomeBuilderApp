# Building Integrity Panel App — Decisions Log
*Working spec, compiled from design conversation. Update as decisions change.*

## Project Overview
Web app (linked from Squarespace) for laying out single-story and loft-style residential homes using Building Integrity's prefabricated straw-core panels. Outputs a floor plan, 3D render, structural/cost/carbon estimates, and a set of construction detail pages — then routes the finished design to the nearest Seed Collaborative fabricator.

**Legal posture:** every output is reference-only. Title blocks state plans are not engineered and not fabricator-produced unless generated under a fabricator login. Current reality: a licensed structural engineer must stamp the fabricator's proposal before anything gets built. Long-term goal: UL listing + IRC/IBC code recognition for prefab straw-core panels.

**Scope:** exterior walls + shell only (no interior walls). Single-story and loft styles only — multistory blocked by jurisdictional limits on non-UL-listed materials.

**Confirmed real-world grounding:** Building Integrity is fabricating New Frameworks' "Casitas" line through the Seed Collaborative partnership (confirmed on buildinteg.com) — the NFW documents in project knowledge are the actual product Building Integrity already builds panels for, not just inspiration. "For Baleheads Only — Standards Roof and Floor Panels.pdf" in project knowledge contains real NDS 2018 (ASD) ClearCalcs beam engineering addressed to 1 South Garth Avenue, Columbia, MO — **still unconfirmed whether this is Building Integrity's own engineering** (possibly an earlier company name or the engineer's working file). Worth confirming — it may already satisfy part of the "pending" structural pre-engineering guide below.

## Construction Methods (first-class, selectable variable)

### Square Bale Panels
NFW-taught method, Building Integrity's current live process (confirmed via buildinteg.com's current copy, which still describes square-baler construction). Kept in the app as a **lighter reference/layout mode only** — not fabricated to anymore.
- Width and thickness locked together: **39" × 14"** (two 18" bales + two 1.5" studs)
- Typically needs continuous exterior plywood for shear, which works against permeability goals — the main reason for switching

### Loose Straw Dense-Packed Panels
Building Integrity's new direction, closer to a comparable European straw-panel producer's approach. **This is the method the calculation engine should fully support.**
- Width and thickness are independent variables (not bale-constrained)
- Fabrication: cut 4 studs, top/bottom plates (¾" ply + two 37" 2x4 runners), web girts (½" ply, 8.5"×38", 2x4 end bars) → bottom plate + studs set into fabricator table → loose straw added, pneumatic piston compresses → girt every 36" rides the piston down the stud guides, screwed off; repeat for remaining girts + top plate → trim, weigh against target density
- Carrot/bracing timbers are carved into the *finished* compressed panel afterward (angle grinder sled + Lancelot blade) — loose-pack has no internal tie the way a bale does, so local carving doesn't unravel surrounding compression

---

## Panel Dimensions (Loose Dense-Pack)
- **Width:** 40" temporary placeholder — legitimately unconstrained now that bale geometry doesn't apply
- **Thickness:** 14", 15.5" (temp. standard), 15.75" — all three selectable
  - 15.5" = 14" + 1.5" (one 2x4), so the fabricator table converts between styles with plain blocking
  - 15.75" ≈ 400mm exactly (a comparable European straw-panel producer's module), and divides a 4' sheet into 3 clean strips (zero waste)

## Target Density
- Suggested starting point: **~75 kg/m³ (~4.7 lb/ft³)** — peer-reviewed compressed-straw fire hazard study, best balance of thermal + fire performance
- General optimal range: 70–120 kg/m³ (~4.4–7.5 lb/ft³); floor ~50 kg/m³ (collapse risk); ceiling ~150 kg/m³ (impractical, thermal falloff)
- A comparable European straw-panel producer's own WUFI reports model their panel at 100 kg/m³ — sits mid-range, good cross-validation
- Straw core VDRF ≈ 1.3 (comparable producer's WUFI reports) — confirms straw is non-limiting for vapor calcs
- Reference densities: plywood/OSB ~36 lb/ft³; framing lumber ~25–35 lb/ft³ @ 10% moisture

## Panel Types (roster)
Standard · Corner · Column (reinforced/plywood-sided, >12' runs needing beam bearing under roof panels, not needed under trusses) · Carrot/Braced (diagonal; spacing by seismic zone, every 4/8/12/16 ft; 2 per corner forming an X; 1 per side of each window) · Header/Lintel (US term: **header**) · Sill · Inclined/Gable · **Safety/Gap Panel** — see below

### Safety/Gap Panel — confirmed detail
- Primary purpose is **dimensional tolerance absorption** between as-designed and as-built wall length, not primarily a structural feature (confirmed via NFW's own notes: "additional plywood to cover this tolerance and margin of error"). The strength increase is a genuine bonus, not the reason it exists.
- Building Integrity's version: standard panel width **minus ¾"**, plus **½" plywood on one face**
- Plywood held back **1¼"** from top and bottom (full-height panels); sill panels hold back from bottom only; header panels hold back from top only
- **Left/right side is always determined looking from the exterior** — universal convention, worth adopting to avoid field mistakes
- Placed farthest from the site's least-accessible side
- Applies to **roof panels too**, not just wall panels (confirmed on NFW's roof panel layouts, marked "SF")
- Open: exact fastener for attaching the ½" plywood skin itself (not yet sourced — likely standard sheathing nails/staples)

## Panel Calculations
Weight (straw volume × density-at-moisture + wood + nails) · density (lb/ft³ + kg/m³) · shear value & load capacity (pending Building Integrity's own pre-engineering numbers — see "For Baleheads Only" note above) · carbon sequestered · price ($28/sqft standard, $36/sqft column, $42/sqft roof, based on biggest face; total = Σ(area×rate) × 1.3 modifier)

---

## Fastener Standard
Building Integrity's system (via NFW precedent) standardizes on **GRK RSS structural screws** (ICC-ES ESR-2442, IBC/IRC code compliant) for nearly all structural wood-to-wood connections, supplemented by Simpson brackets/hangers at specific hardware connections. Real, sourced spacing table so far:

| Connection | Fastener | Spacing |
|---|---|---|
| Jack stud to panel | GRK 5/16"×4" star drive washer head | 24" o.c., interior & exterior |
| Panel to panel, interior | GRK 5/16"×4" star drive washer head | 24" o.c., staggered "stitching"/zipper pattern |
| Panel to panel, exterior | GRK 5/16"×4" star drive washer head | **16" o.c., staggered** (Building Integrity's resolved value — NFW's own two source docs conflicted at 6" vs 18") |
| Corner connection | GRK 5/16"×5⅛" star drive washer head | 18" o.c., 45° toe screw; paired at cross piece, 1" edge distance, 1½" between pair |
| Pier to beam | (4) Simpson SDS ¼"×4½" | 4 per connection |
| Floor panel to beam | GRK 3/8"×7¼" or 8" RSS | 12" o.c., 45° toe screw |
| Toe-up to floor panel | 16d nails | 12" o.c. interior, 6" o.c. exterior |
| Wall panel to toe-up | GRK 5/16"×5⅛" star drive washer head | 18" o.c., 45° toe screw, min. 3 per panel at exterior |

All values are NFW reference points — confirm against Building Integrity's own engineering before treating as final.

## Openings
- **Jack stud:** ¾" plywood, **U-shaped** (symmetric legs, not lopsided), toe-up to header, nailed to adjacent panels. Notch is 3"×5.5", cradles a double 2x6 (double 2x8 for spans up to 12 ft, notch deepens to 7.25"). **Top of the beam sits flush with the top of both legs** so the header panel bears evenly across the whole assembly. Beam secured with a metal hanger — model/size not yet selected, needs sizing to actual reaction load. Matches NFW's own header panel bill of materials ("2x6 x2" callout).
- **Window buck:** thermally broken, positioned **⅓ of wall depth in from the exterior face**. Buck's own fabrication method still open/schematic.
- **Doors:** two-leaf — screen door toward exterior face, 36" exterior-rated door toward interior face, same ⅓-depth logic as the buck

## Wall Assembly Finishes
- **Interior:** clay plaster direct-on-straw w/ paper+lath, OR Intello Plus (0.13–13.2 perm, variable) + furring + drywall
- **Exterior:** lime plaster direct-on-straw w/ paper+lath, OR Mento (38 perm, fixed) + furring + siding, OR timber board (wood-fiber insulation board, continuous thermal break), OR plywood + Adhero 3000 (8 perm) + furring + siding (needed near openings)
- **Permeability modeled as resistance-in-series** (1÷perm adds, not perm itself) — e.g. Intello+Mento assembly ≈ 0.13 perm winter, ≈ 9.8 perm summer
- **Validation rule:** flag any assembly where the exterior side isn't more vapor-open than the interior side

## Roof / Floor
- **Roof:** Adhero 3000 or Mento for underlayment; truss vs. roof-panel choice affects column-panel requirement; beam sizing depends on roof angle; dormer panels possible; safety/gap panels apply here too
- **Floor:** DIY EZ floor, structural panel floor (bathroom/step-panel option), thermally broken slab, crawlspace/basement/root cellar; Adhero Visto (1.1 perm, transparent) for floor wrap — **open: permanent layer or construction-phase-only?**

## Foundation Type
Moved to **early app sequencing** (with zip/seismic/units/site-accessibility).
- Standard: vented crawlspace on helical screw piers, full clearance
- Full load path confirmed: helical pier → wood beam → floor panel → toe-up (ext./int. 2x4 with 1½" wood fiberboard between, for thermal continuity) → wall panel bottom plate
- Floor vapor direction depends on foundation type: vented crawlspace → more open on the bottom (Mento). Slab and unvented basement/root cellar need their own logic — **not yet defined.**

## Wet-Area Waterproofing
- Flag the **whole tiled room**, not just the fixture zone
- **RedGard** (liquid-applied, ICC-ES ESR-1413, IAPMO-listed) over standard backer board — DIY-friendly default over Schluter-Kerdi
- Own visual flag + review-log/BOM line

---

## Output & Documentation
- Standard outputs: 2D floor plan, 3D render (angle set still TBD), aggregate totals (carbon, shear/load, price), disclaimer on every output, recommended-products appendix
- **Detail Guide Pages** — format validated and built out for 6 of 7 starter details:
  1. ✅ Wet-area floor waterproofing
  2. ✅ Window/door buck & jack stud (depth positioning)
  3. ✅ Jack stud & header beam (U-notch, double 2x6/2x8, hanger)
  4. ✅ Toe-up & foundation anchoring (full pier-to-wall load path)
  5. ✅ Panel-to-panel connections (straight seam + corner)
  6. ✅ Safety/gap panel
  7. ⬜ Floor-to-wall vapor continuity (synthesis detail — tying Mento/Intello logic through the toe-up transition) — **not yet built**
  - Template: branded header (logo + wordmark), title/trigger condition, parameterized diagram, fastener schedule (omitted if not applicable), notes, disclaimer + sign-off footer
- **Style:** NFW's Casitas Terra title block as structural template + Building Integrity's own logo. Simplified logo (blue + white, no gold) chosen for the small recurring title-block corner; full-color version (blue house, gold wheat) reserved for cover sheets. Tagline: *"The performance of modern construction. The integrity of natural materials."*
- **Review log:** every design ships an "Items for Engineer/Contractor Review" list, auto-populated from assumptions/reference values/validation flags

### Print / PDF export — paged-media rules
Both export paths (a note's own 🖶 button → `data-print-mode="page"`, and the "Export PDF" packet → `data-print-mode="packet"`) end in the browser's own Print / Save-as-PDF. On screen this app is a floating sticky-note editor; on paper it is a stack of sheets. **Every rule below lives inside `@media print` — screen layout and appearance are untouched.**

- **A sheet is a sheet: one fabrication sheet = one printed page.** The black frame and the right-hand title-block strip are the *edge of the sheet*, and they print exactly once. In print, `.sheet` releases its screen shape (`aspect-ratio` and `min-height` reset, `overflow: visible`) and is left free to size to its content — deliberately **uncapped**. An earlier attempt pinned it to the exact page box derived from the `@page` rules; that was reverted. Because `box-sizing: border-box` puts the 3px frame *inside* the height, the cap closed the frame precisely at the page boundary while the overflow painted into the unprintable margin — turning a truncated sheet into one that looked complete. `break-inside: avoid` on `.sheet` was dropped for the same reason. Native fragmentation is ugly when it happens; it never loses content.
  - This reframes an earlier print decision (Tommy: *"if it spills over to needing more than one page, then additional pages are made for that content"*, `SheetTitleBlock.module.css`). That instruction always held for the **content**; it was never meant to make the frame and title block reappear on page 2, which is what it actually did. Fragmenting a bordered flex row redraws the frame and an empty title-block column on the next page — Tommy read that as *"it puts it on two pages and it's duplicated."* It was never a duplicate render.
  - **Overflow policy — decided 2026-08-27 by Tommy, not yet built:** when a sheet's content genuinely exceeds one page, the remainder continues on **numbered continuation sheets** — each page a real framed sheet with its own title block, reading "Sheet 2 of 3". `SheetTitleBlock` already takes `sheetNumber`/`sheetCount` from `DocumentMetaContext`, so the metadata exists; the pagination does not. Rejected alternatives: unframed continuation pages, and auto-shrink-to-fit. Until it is built, an over-length sheet fragments natively and redraws its frame and title block on the continuation page. **Silent clipping is never acceptable** — losing a cut-list row off the bottom of a shop sheet is the worst possible failure here, and is exactly why the height cap was reverted rather than kept.
- **Scroll containers must be neutralized in print.** A `overflow: hidden`/`auto` box is unfragmentable — the browser clips it instead of flowing it. `SheetTitleBlock.module.css` already did this for `.sheet`/`.content`/`.titleZone`, but the shared StickyNote wrapper one layer up (`.note` `overflow: hidden`, `.body` `overflow-y: auto`) never got the same treatment: globals.css's shared print block reset display/position/inset/width/height/max-height/box-shadow but not `overflow`, so anything past the first page was silently cut off. That block now also resets `overflow` and `max-width` — an unreset `max-width: calc(100vw - 48px)` was printing the sheet 960px wide on a 1008px page, since `vw` resolves against the page area in paged media. Any new scrolling container anywhere in the app needs a print reset.
- **Sticky-note chrome never prints.** The note's yellow/gold card (background, border, radius, body padding) and its header bar with the live 🖶 / ⤢ / × buttons are editor UI, not document. They belong to the shared print block, not to any one page type — this affects every printed section, not just fabrication.
- **Screen-only guidance blurbs never print.** The "Fabricator/detailer document — one sheet per unique panel…" paragraphs above the fabrication sheets are on-screen orientation text; on paper they push the sheet down and eat page height. Marked opt-in with the existing `print-hidden-chrome` class rather than blanket-hiding `styles.note` (75 uses in `page.tsx`, several of which are honest caveats that *should* print).
- **"Last section" must be identified explicitly, not by `:last-of-type`.** `:last-of-type` matches the last element of its *element type* among siblings — not the last element matching the rest of the selector. StickyNotes are `div`s among many sibling `div`s emitted from several separate `.map()` groups, so the packet's "no page break after the final section" rule effectively never fired, and every multi-section export ended with a blank page. The last target is marked imperatively in document order at print time, alongside the existing `data-print-target` bookkeeping.

## Handoff
Digital handoff to the nearest Seed Collaborative fabricator's in-app inbox, labeled "Proposal" with a note field.

## Roles
Public/homeowner vs. Fabricator login — different disclaimer treatment. Square Bale mode: lighter reference/layout mode only, not the full calculation engine.

## Provisional Values — the `status` flag convention

Every spec-derived number in `packages/panel-catalog/src/data.ts` is wrapped in a `CatalogValue<T>`, `CatalogRange`, or `PanelStructuralStatus` carrying `status: "confirmed" | "pending-BI-confirmation"` plus a `note` tracing back to its source. This is the machine-readable half of this decisions log: **the log says what was decided, the flag says how solid it is.**

- `"confirmed"` — traceable to Building Integrity, the New Frameworks source documents, Tommy's own spreadsheets, or a manufacturer/ICC listing.
- `"pending-BI-confirmation"` — researched, industry-typical, or interpreted from a verbal description. Plausible, not authoritative.
- `PanelStructuralStatus` deliberately carries **no `value` field**. Inventing a placeholder for straw-panel structural capacity has no reasonable industry analog to fall back on (unlike, say, a standard concrete or steel product), so it surfaces the gap honestly instead of filling it.

`toReviewLog()` in `packages/calc-engine/src/reviewLog.ts` filters for pending entries — that is what populates the "Items for Engineer/Contractor Review" list on every output. **An unflagged value never reaches the review log**, so marking a researched number `confirmed` silently drops it off the engineer's list. That is the failure mode this convention exists to prevent, and it is worse than an obvious bug because a plausible number doesn't look wrong.

Current state: 77 `pending-BI-confirmation` vs. 58 `confirmed` in `data.ts`. Flags also appear in `packages/panel-catalog/src/types.ts`, `packages/calc-engine/src/reviewLog.ts`, `apps/web/app/page.tsx`, and `apps/web/app/wallReviewNotes.ts`.

### Flags check — run before any change is called done
1. Does every real-world number in the diff carry a `status` and a `note`?
2. Is anything marked `confirmed` that is actually researched, industry-typical, or interpreted from a verbal description? Downgrade it.
3. Does the `note` trace to a real source — a spec quote, a named document, an Open Item — rather than just restating the number?
4. If the figure is structural (shear, load-bearing), does it use `PanelStructuralStatus` with no invented value?
5. Does the value surface in the review log where a human reviewer would expect to see it?
6. If the spec marks the underlying decision open/pending/unconfirmed, is the code treating it as provisional rather than settled?

### What is provisional right now, by area
- **Structural capacity** — every panel's `shearValue` / `loadBearingCapacity` across the roster, plus `shearLoadCapacity`. All carry `STRUCTURAL_PENDING_NOTE`; blocked on Building Integrity's own pre-engineering numbers (see "For Baleheads Only" above).
- **Seismic bracing** — `seismicBracedPanelSpacingFt`, `bracedWallLineSpacingFt`.
- **Fastener schedule** — `fastenerTableStatus` covers the whole spacing table.
- **Headers & openings** — `bigHeaderWidthInRange`, `bigHeaderHeightInRange`, the big-header defaults, `headerPreviewHeightIn`, `windowHeaderWidthInRange`.
- **Standard window sizes** — `standardWindowWidthsIn`, `standardWindowHeightsIn`, `standardWindowHeightDefaultIn`.
- **Panel thickness default** — `looseDensePackDefaultThicknessIn` (the 14/15.5/15.75 option set).
- **Wall assembly layers** — several entries in `wallAssemblyLayers`.
- **Densities & carbon** — `carbonFractionOfDryMass`, `timberHpDensityLbFt3`, `densePackCelluloseDensityLbFt3`, and the pending entry in `referenceDensities`.
- **Foundation** — `groundScrewProductsStatus` and several `foundationTypes` entries.
- **Floor framing** — `floorRimJoistDetail`, `floorLongSideBlockingNote`, and a pending `floorJoistTypes` entry.
- **Roof** — `trussPlateInsetDefaultIn`, `gableHeelHeightDefaultIn`.
- **Shipping** — `truckBedTypes` (trailer interior dimensions cross-referenced from industry equipment guides, not a manufacturer sheet), `shippingRatePerMileDefault` ($6/mile one-way), `headerSillDunnageGapIn`.
- **Plaster Master** — all of `plasterPriceDefaults` (sand $45/cu-yd, clay $19/bag, lime $10/bag, straw $1.25/cu-ft, labor $45/hr), `steelMeshPriceDefaults`, and one entry in `plasterMixPartsDefaults`. The source "Faster Plaster Calculator" spreadsheet contains **zero pricing data** — every dollar figure here is this app's own researched placeholder. The formulas themselves mirror the spreadsheet exactly and are confirmed.
- **BOM** — `bomWidthMismatchWarning`.

### Provisional beyond the flags
Things that are interpreted or unresolved but aren't a single flaggable number:

- **Braced Panel geometry** (`packages/panel-catalog/src/bracedPanelMembers.ts`) — Tommy called the first-draft 3D model "a good start" and explicitly flagged it for editing later. The diagonal brace's angle-cut ends are simplified to a straight tilted box (no real bevel/miter), and the girt-row rule (3 rows baseline, +1 per 36" bay overage) plus the middle-row pick for the brace's bottom end are interpretations of a verbal description, not read off a shop drawing. Expect changes; don't treat as locked.
- **Shipping packing model** — a deliberately simplified uniform-grid packer (every stack in a shipment shares one footprint sized to the widest panel), not a true bin-packing optimizer. The truck count and load order shown are illustrative, consistent with the app's reference-only posture. Not a real optimized load plan.
- **Interior clay-plaster Finish Coat recipe** — the Sand:Clay 3:1 ratio is this app's own adaptation, confirmed by Tommy as the default. The source spreadsheet only ever gave a Sand:Lime finish recipe.
- **Buck window** — flagged by Tommy as a window-opening approach to consider (a separate rough "buck" frame set into the opening). This is a bare flag with no spec behind it. Ask for the actual detail before building anything; don't infer it from the current window/header/sill decomposition.
- **SketchUp / Dynamic Component export** — blocked on Tommy's conversation with Cameron, who has an existing SketchUp DC library for these same building blocks. True `.skp` can't be written outside SketchUp, so the realistic path is a Ruby script run inside SketchUp that reads this app's JSON component schema and places instances of Cameron's DCs. That only works if the schema's member roles/ids/dimensions line up with how his DCs are parameterized. The plain OBJ exporter has no such dependency and is safe to extend.

## Open Items
- **Confirm:** is "For Baleheads Only" Building Integrity's own engineering (possibly earlier company name)?
- Metal hanger model for the jack stud beam connection — needs sizing to actual load
- Fastener for attaching safety/gap panel's ½" plywood skin
- Floor-to-wall vapor continuity detail — still to be built
- Adhero Visto: permanent floor layer or construction-phase-only?
- "Typical architect angle" set for 3D renders
- **Numbered continuation sheets — decided, not built.** Tommy's call (2026-08-27): each continuation page is a real framed sheet with its own title block, numbered "Sheet 2 of 3". Rejected: unframed continuation pages, and auto-shrink-to-fit. Metadata already exists (`sheetNumber`/`sheetCount`); the pagination does not. Until it lands, over-length sheets fragment natively and redraw the frame — ugly but non-lossy. Measured cases that need it: a braced-chevron fabrication sheet once **one** plaster coat is selected (~28px over) or its instance list wraps to a second line, and the Shipping / Plaster Master / Project Summary pages, which run 1–2.5 pages over on any page size. Nobody has yet run a real browser print to confirm CSS fragmentation behaves as reasoned — the measurements to date are analytic.
- **Print audit of the other sections' `styles.note` paragraphs** — the fabrication intro blurbs are being marked screen-only; the other ~70 uses in `page.tsx` haven't been reviewed. Some (e.g. the shop-drawing "Preview-only — illustrative default dimensions" caveat) probably *should* print. Fold in one related item while doing it: `StickyNote`'s `.label` is now the printed document's only title for the notes that render no `SheetTitleBlock` (Review Log, Project Totals, Assembly Performance), and it still carries `overflow: hidden; text-overflow: ellipsis; white-space: nowrap` with no print reset — latent today (nothing is near truncating at full page width), but it is a silent-truncation container sitting on a title. Worth a pass later; not folded into the fabrication fix.
- Single nearest fabricator vs. broadcast to a few for handoff
- Detail page numbering scheme
- **Still pending from Tommy:** structural elements pre-engineering guide, panel parameters, and Base Set drawings (unless "For Baleheads Only" turns out to cover this)
- **Code-level provisional values** — tracked separately as `pending-BI-confirmation` flags in the catalog rather than as bullets here; see "Provisional Values" above for the full list and the flags check.
