# Building Integrity Panel App — Decisions Log
*Working spec, compiled from design conversation. Update as decisions change.*

## Project Overview
Web app (linked from Squarespace) for laying out single-story and loft-style residential homes using Building Integrity's prefabricated straw-core panels. Outputs a floor plan, 3D render, structural/cost/carbon estimates, and a set of construction detail pages — then routes the finished design to the nearest Seed Collaborative fabricator.

**Legal posture:** every output is reference-only. Title blocks state plans are not engineered and not fabricator-produced unless generated under a fabricator login. Current reality: a licensed structural engineer must stamp the fabricator's proposal before anything gets built. Long-term goal: UL listing + IRC/IBC code recognition for prefab straw-core panels.

**Scope:** exterior walls + shell only (no interior walls). Single-story and loft styles only — multistory blocked by jurisdictional limits on non-UL-listed materials.

**Confirmed real-world grounding:** Building Integrity is fabricating New Frameworks' "Casitas" line through the Seed Collaborative partnership (confirmed on buildinteg.com) — the NFW documents in project knowledge are the actual product Building Integrity already builds panels for, not just inspiration. "For Baleheads Only — Standards Roof and Floor Panels.pdf" in project knowledge contains real NDS 2018 (ASD) ClearCalcs beam engineering addressed to 1 South Garth Avenue, Columbia, MO — **still unconfirmed whether this is Building Integrity's own engineering** (possibly an earlier company name or the engineer's working file). Worth confirming — it may already satisfy part of the "pending" structural pre-engineering guide below.

## Construction Methods (first-class, selectable variable)

### Square Bale Panels
NFW-taught method, Building Integrity's current live process (confirmed via buildinteg.com's current copy, which still describes square-baler construction). Kept in the app as a **lighter reference/layout mode only** — not fabricated to anymore.
- Width and thickness locked together: **39" × 14"** (two 18" bales + two 1.5" studs)
- Typically needs continuous exterior plywood for shear, which works against permeability goals — the main reason for switching

### Loose Straw Dense-Packed Panels
Building Integrity's new direction, closer to a comparable European straw-panel producer's approach. **This is the method the calculation engine should fully support.**
- Width and thickness are independent variables (not bale-constrained)
- Fabrication: cut 4 studs, top/bottom plates (¾" ply + two 37" 2x4 runners), web girts (½" ply, 8.5"×38", 2x4 end bars) → bottom plate + studs set into fabricator table → loose straw added, pneumatic piston compresses → girt every 36" rides the piston down the stud guides, screwed off; repeat for remaining girts + top plate → trim, weigh against target density
- Carrot/bracing timbers are carved into the *finished* compressed panel afterward (angle grinder sled + Lancelot blade) — loose-pack has no internal tie the way a bale does, so local carving doesn't unravel surrounding compression

---

## Panel Dimensions (Loose Dense-Pack)
- **Width:** 40" temporary placeholder — legitimately unconstrained now that bale geometry doesn't apply
- **Thickness:** 14", 15.5" (temp. standard), 15.75" — all three selectable
  - 15.5" = 14" + 1.5" (one 2x4), so the fabricator table converts between styles with plain blocking
  - 15.75" ≈ 400mm exactly (a comparable European straw-panel producer's module), and divides a 4' sheet into 3 clean strips (zero waste)

## Target Density
- Suggested starting point: **~75 kg/m³ (~4.7 lb/ft³)** — peer-reviewed compressed-straw fire hazard study, best balance of thermal + fire performance
- General optimal range: 70–120 kg/m³ (~4.4–7.5 lb/ft³); floor ~50 kg/m³ (collapse risk); ceiling ~150 kg/m³ (impractical, thermal falloff)
- A comparable European straw-panel producer's own WUFI reports model their panel at 100 kg/m³ — sits mid-range, good cross-validation
- Straw core VDRF ≈ 1.3 (comparable producer's WUFI reports) — confirms straw is non-limiting for vapor calcs
- Reference densities: plywood/OSB ~36 lb/ft³; framing lumber ~25–35 lb/ft³ @ 10% moisture

## Panel Types (roster)
Standard · Corner · Column (reinforced/plywood-sided, >12' runs needing beam bearing under roof panels, not needed under trusses) · Carrot/Braced (diagonal; spacing by seismic zone, every 4/8/12/16 ft; 2 per corner forming an X; 1 per side of each window) · Header/Lintel (US term: **header**) · Sill · Inclined/Gable · **Safety/Gap Panel** — see below

### Safety/Gap Panel — confirmed detail
- Primary purpose is **dimensional tolerance absorption** between as-designed and as-built wall length, not primarily a structural feature (confirmed via NFW's own notes: "additional plywood to cover this tolerance and margin of error"). The strength increase is a genuine bonus, not the reason it exists.
- Building Integrity's version: standard panel width **minus ¾"**, plus **½" plywood on one face**
- Plywood held back **1¼"** from top and bottom (full-height panels); sill panels hold back from bottom only; header panels hold back from top only
- **Left/right side is always determined looking from the exterior** — universal convention, worth adopting to avoid field mistakes
- Placed farthest from the site's least-accessible side
- Applies to **roof panels too**, not just wall panels (confirmed on NFW's roof panel layouts, marked "SF")
- Open: exact fastener for attaching the ½" plywood skin itself (not yet sourced — likely standard sheathing nails/staples)

## Panel Calculations
Weight (straw volume × density-at-moisture + wood + nails) · density (lb/ft³ + kg/m³) · shear value & load capacity (pending Building Integrity's own pre-engineering numbers — see "For Baleheads Only" note above) · carbon sequestered · price ($28/sqft standard, $36/sqft column, $42/sqft roof, based on biggest face; total = Σ(area×rate) × 1.3 modifier)

## Fastener Standard
Building Integrity's system (via NFW precedent) standardizes on **GRK RSS structural screws** (ICC-ES ESR-2442, IBC/IRC code compliant) for nearly all structural wood-to-wood connections, supplemented by Simpson brackets/hangers at specific hardware connections. Real, sourced spacing table so far:

| Connection | Fastener | Spacing |
|---|---|---|
| Jack stud to panel | GRK 5/16"×4" star drive washer head | 24" o.c., interior & exterior |
| Panel to panel, interior | GRK 5/16"×4" star drive washer head | 24" o.c., staggered "stitching"/zipper pattern |
| Panel to panel, exterior | GRK 5/16"×4" star drive washer head | **16" o.c., staggered** (Building Integrity's resolved value — NFW's own two source docs conflicted at 6" vs 18") |
| Corner connection | GRK 5/16"×5⅛" star drive washer head | 18" o.c., 45° toe screw; paired at cross piece, 1" edge distance, 1½" between pair |
| Pier to beam | (4) Simpson SDS ¼"×4½" | 4 per connection |
| Floor panel to beam | GRK 3/8"×7¼" or 8" RSS | 12" o.c., 45° toe screw |
| Toe-up to floor panel | 16d nails | 12" o.c. interior, 6" o.c. exterior |
| Wall panel to toe-up | GRK 5/16"×5⅛" star drive washer head | 18" o.c., 45° toe screw, min. 3 per panel at exterior |

All values are NFW reference points — confirm against Building Integrity's own engineering before treating as final.

## Openings
- **Jack stud:** ¾" plywood, **U-shaped** (symmetric legs, not lopsided), toe-up to header, nailed to adjacent panels. Notch is 3"×5.5", cradles a double 2x6 (double 2x8 for spans up to 12 ft, notch deepens to 7.25"). **Top of the beam sits flush with the top of both legs** so the header panel bears evenly across the whole assembly. Beam secured with a metal hanger — model/size not yet selected, needs sizing to actual reaction load. Matches NFW's own header panel bill of materials ("2x6 x2" callout).
- **Window buck:** thermally broken, positioned **⅓ of wall depth in from the exterior face**. Buck's own fabrication method still open/schematic.
- **Doors:** two-leaf — screen door toward exterior face, 36" exterior-rated door toward interior face, same ⅓-depth logic as the buck

## Wall Assembly Finishes
- **Interior:** clay plaster direct-on-straw w/ paper+lath, OR Intello Plus (0.13–13.2 perm, variable) + furring + drywall
- **Exterior:** lime plaster direct-on-straw w/ paper+lath, OR Mento (38 perm, fixed) + furring + siding, OR timber board (wood-fiber insulation board, continuous thermal break), OR plywood + Adhero 3000 (8 perm) + furring + siding (needed near openings)
- **Permeability modeled as resistance-in-series** (1÷perm adds, not perm itself) — e.g. Intello+Mento assembly ≈ 0.13 perm winter, ≈ 9.8 perm summer
- **Validation rule:** flag any assembly where the exterior side isn't more vapor-open than the interior side

## Roof / Floor
- **Roof:** Adhero 3000 or Mento for underlayment; truss vs. roof-panel choice affects column-panel requirement; beam sizing depends on roof angle; dormer panels possible; safety/gap panels apply here too
- **Floor:** DIY EZ floor, structural panel floor (bathroom/step-panel option), thermally broken slab, crawlspace/basement/root cellar; Adhero Visto (1.1 perm, transparent) for floor wrap — **open: permanent layer or construction-phase-only?**

## Foundation Type
Moved to **early app sequencing** (with zip/seismic/units/site-accessibility).
- Standard: vented crawlspace on helical screw piers, full clearance
- Full load path confirmed: helical pier → wood beam → floor panel → toe-up (ext./int. 2x4 with 1½" wood fiberboard between, for thermal continuity) → wall panel bottom plate
- Floor vapor direction depends on foundation type: vented crawlspace → more open on the bottom (Mento). Slab and unvented basement/root cellar need their own logic — **not yet defined.**

## Wet-Area Waterproofing
- Flag the **whole tiled room**, not just the fixture zone
- **RedGard** (liquid-applied, ICC-ES ESR-1413, IAPMO-listed) over standard backer board — DIY-friendly default over Schluter-Kerdi
- Own visual flag + review-log/BOM line

  - Template: branded header (logo + wordmark), title/trigger condition, parameterized diagram, fastener schedule (omitted if not applicable), notes, disclaimer + sign-off footer
- **Style:** NFW's Casitas Terra title block as structural template + Building Integrity's own logo. Simplified logo (blue + white, no gold) chosen for the small recurring title-block corner; full-color version (blue house, gold wheat) reserved for cover sheets. Tagline: *"The performance of modern construction. The integrity of natural materials."*
